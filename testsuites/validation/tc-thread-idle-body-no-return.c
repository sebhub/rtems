 * @brief Tests thread idle body behaviour.
 *
 * This test case performs the following actions:
 *
 * - Create threads which execute an thread idle body.  Check that the thread
 *   idle body does not return.  If it would return, then an
 *   INTERNAL_ERROR_THREAD_EXITTED fatal error would occur.
 *
 *   - Check that the CPU port thread idle body does not return.
 *
 *   - Where the BSP provides an idle thread body, check that it does not
 *     return.
 *
 *   - Clean up all used resources.
