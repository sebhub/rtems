  Set the value of RELOCADDR to the address where you want your image to load.
  If you'll be using GRUB to load the images it will have to be >= 0x100000
  (1024K). If you are using NetBoot to load the images it can be
  >= 0x10000 (64K) AND <= 0x97C00 (607K) OR >= 0x100000 (1024K). The memory
  top is of course another limit. Make sure there is enough space before the
  upper memory limits for the image and the memory allocated by it to fit.
  Make sure the value you choose is aligned to 4 bytes.
